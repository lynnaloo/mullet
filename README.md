# The Mullet Stack

[Facebook](http://facebook.github.io/react/) in the front. [Walmart](http://walmartlabs.github.io/hapi/) in the back.

All sitting on top of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

### Get the Party Started

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

Setup the mullet stack:
```
git clone https://github.com/lynnaloo/mullet
cd mullet
npm install
```

OR 

Install the mullet npm module:

```
npm install mullet
```

Start the Mullet Server:
```
npm start
```

### Party On

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to see the index page!

### But Seriously

This setup is a decent starting place to play around with Node.js, Hapi, and React.js.
