Get the Party Started
----

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (Mullet requires at least Node 4)

### Setup the Mullet stack for development:
```
git clone https://github.com/lynnaloo/mullet
cd mullet
npm install
```

Start the Mullet Server:
```
npm start
```

Watch the client folders for changes during development:
```
npm run watch
```

#### OR

### Install the Mullet npm module:

```
npm install mullet
```

Start the Mullet Server:
```
npm start mullet
```

Party On!

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to see the sample page!

#### But what about server-side rendering?

But Seriously
----

This setup is a decent starting place to play around with React and Hapi.

To get started, edit the sample React component: `src/react_components/facebook.js`
